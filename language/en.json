    "description": "  Hello! I am passionate about programming and technology. I love putting myself to the test every day with the challenges that I find. It motivates me a lot to know that this world of technology is so immense, especially being able to learn something new every day that contributes to my evolution. In my free time I like to play Chess♟️, being able to face different players from all over the world online, at the same time that it stimulates my capacity for analysis and imagination. I like to go to the gym🏋🏿 to exercise and relax a bit and finally play soccer❤️⚽. This helps me to disconnect from my daily activities, relax and dedicate time to myself. <br> My motto is to always be <b>POSITIVE</b> regardless of the adversities that life throws your way💪🏿🙌🏿.<br><br>I am a proactive person, excellent teammate, organized and responsible. I really enjoy learning new things, so my goal is a challenging and dynamic position where I can gain new knowledge, develop my skills and gain work experience."
